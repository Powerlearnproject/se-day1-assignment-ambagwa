#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is  the science and art of creating efficient and easy-to-use software solutions to real-world problems. Some of its importance in the technology  industry include:
  - The practices in software engineering such as testing, debugging and version control helps produce high quality and reliable software solutions.
  - Software engineers incorporate safety practices in their systems which aid in data and systems privacy.
  - Solutions built are easily scalable making them easy to handle more users and workload without affecting performance.
  - Software engineering drives more technological advancements in other fields such as AI, IoT, and cybersecurity.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

I. The birth of "Software Engineering".
  - This term  waas first coined in 1968 at the NATO Software Engineering Conference. The problems that faced software development at the term raised the need for structured methodologies and best practices.
II. The Rise of Structured Programming.
  - This led to improved software readability, maintanability, and reliability. Loops and conditionals replaced traditional GGOTO statements. This led to the development of programming languages such as C and        Pascal.
III. The Advent of Agile Methodologies.
  - Being first introduced in 2001, it emphsized on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback over traditional rigidility. Software started being deeloped iteratively and changing requirements were           responded to quickly. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is the structured process design, develop, and test high quality software. Its main objectives is to develop high quality, maintanable software that meets the user's requirements. It comprises of six stages, i.e.:
  i. Planning and requirement analysis. In the organization, this is attainable from customer inputs and sales department. This information the forms the basis of the building blocks of the project. 
  ii. Defining requirements. Functional and technical requirements are defined. The requirements are then reviewed and approveed. This leads to the development of a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document.
  iii. Designing architecture. The architecture of the software, database structure, and user interfaces are created from the SRS document. A low-level design document is crafted and after evaluating all possible factors, a high-level design document is crafted based on the most logical and practical design.
  iv. Developing the product. Programming languages, tools, and frameworks are selected for development. The actual code is then written by developers based on the design specifications. Protocols set by the associations must also be followed.
  v. Product testing and integration. Although minimal testing is done at each phase, it is at this phase that software is tested for bugs, perfomance issues, and software vulnerabilities to ensure smooth running. Documentation, training, and support sre also done at this stage. The types of testing done include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.
  vi. Deployment and maintenance. The software is released to users in a live environment and this is done either in phases or all at once. To ensure its smooth operation and to fulfil user feedback, the software is reqularly maintained and updated. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology is a linear and sequentilal model that emphasizes the completion of one phase before moving on to the next and emphasizes that once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed. It is suitable for small projects with clear and suitable requirements such as developing a payroll system for a gevernment institution. The agile methodology on the other hand takes an iterative and flexible approach, breaking the project into small cycles that are based on continuous feedback and collaboration. It is suitable for developing a food delivery application where new features and improvements must be releasedd regularly. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

- A software developer is responsible for utilizing the techical requirements from the technical team and write clean and efficient code to make the software function. They then debug and troubleshoot software issues. They are also the link between designers and testers.
- A quality assurance engineer ensusres the software meets the organization's quality standards by detecting and preventing defects. The design and execute test cases, test plans, and test scripts. Manual and automated testing is also done by them to identify bugs. They ensure compliance with the industry standards and company policies.
- A project manager oversees the entire software development process and that it is timely and successful upon completion. They define the project scope, objectives and deliverables. They manage team coordination, timelines and resource allocation. They also communicate with stakeholders, clients, and developers while ensuring the project stays within the budget and stipulated timelines. 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-An IDE is a softwaresuite that contains the tools to write, edit, debug, and test code. It provides features such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and debugging tools that speed up production. It also improves the quality of code and simplifies debugging while supporting many languages and frameworks. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ Idea, Ecclipse, and Android Studio
- A VCS is a collection of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping track of the modifications made to those files. This makes it easier for several developers to work on  the same project without conflicts. In the case of conflicts, a history of all changes made is kept making it easier to revert to the previous changes. Data loss is also prevented through backups and recovery. Examples include Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

- Managing large codebases, some of which are poorly structured. To keep the code maintanable, follow modular approach. Document code for easier readability while also commenting it out.
- Debbuging and fixing bugs. Use debugging tools while implementing automated testing to catch bugs early.
- Keeping up with the rapidly changing technologies. Follow tech blogs and join developer communities. Contribute  to open-source projects to gain hands-on experience on new tools.
- Time management and timely deadlines. Use agile methodologies and implement project management tools such as Jira and Trello.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

i. Unit testing. Invelves testing individual methods and functions of the classes and models used by your software. Are easier to automate and can run very quickly in a continuous integration server. Helps is identifying bugs early while maintaining code quality and saving on debugging time.
ii. Integration testing. This verifies that different modules used by your application work well together. Are more expensive considering that multiple parts of the application must be up and running. Bugs arising from combining multiple modules are prevented. Also ensures smooth integration with external services.
iii. System testing. Evaluates the entire application as a complete system to ensure it meets functional and non-functional requirements. Compatibility issues are identified across different platforms. 
iv. Acceptance testing. Users verify if the system meets the business requirements before the release. Ensures the system is user-friendly and meets customer expectations. 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

This is the process of designing and refining input prompts to guide AI models to generate more accurate, relevant, and useful responses. Instructions are crafted, context provided, and queries atructured in a way that maximizes the model's output quality. This helps enhance AI output's quality, improves its efficiency in tasks, customize its behavior for specific needs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

A vague prompt - "Tell me about technology"

Improved prompt - "Prive a 200-word summary on how AI is transforming healthcare, proving at leaast two realworld examples".

The improved prompt is effective because it focuses on a pecific topic, concise and clear, and includes context.
